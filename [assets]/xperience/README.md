## Install

Select an option:
* Option 1 - If you want to use `xperience` as a standalone resource then import `xperience_standalone.sql` only
* Option 2 - If using `ESX` with `Config.UseESX` set to `true` then import `xperience_esx.sql` only. This adds the `xp` and `rank` columns to the `users` table
    - If you're transitioning from `esx_xp`, then don't import `xperience_esx.sql`, instead see [Transitioning from esx_xp](#transitioning-from-esx_xp)
* Option 3 - If using `QBCore` with `Config.UseQBCore` set to `true` then there's no need to import any `sql` files as the xp and rank are saved to the player's metadata - see [QBCore Integration](#qbcore-integration)

then:

* Drop the `xperience` directory into you `resources` directory
* Add `ensure xperience` to your `server.cfg` file

By default this resource uses `oxmysql`, but if you don't want to use / install it then you can use `mysql-async` by following these instructions:

* Uncomment the `'@mysql-async/lib/MySQL.lua',` line in `fxmanifest.lua` and comment out the `'@oxmysql/lib/MySQL.lua'` line

## Transitioning from esx_xp
If you previously used `esx_xp` and are still using `es_extended` then do the following to make your current stored xp / rank data compatible with `xperience` 
* Rename the `rp_xp` column in the `users` table to `xp`
* Rename the `rp_rank` column in the `users` table to `rank`
* Set `Config.UseESX` to `true`

TriggerClientEvent('xperience:client:removeXP', playerId --[[ integer ]], xp --[[ integer ]])

TriggerClientEvent('xperience:client:setXP', playerId --[[ integer ]], xp --[[ integer ]])

```

#### Server Events
```lua
RegisterNetEvent('xperience:server:rankUp', function(newRank, previousRank)
    -- do something when player ranks up
end)

RegisterNetEvent('xperience:server:rankDown', function(newRank, previousRank)
    -- do something when player ranks down
end)
```

## Rank Actions
You can define callbacks on each rank by using the `Action` function.

The function will be called both when the player reaches the rank and drops to the rank.

You can check whether the player reached or dropped to the new rank by utilising the `rankUp` parameter.

```lua
Config.Ranks = {
    [1] = { XP = 0 },
    [2] = {
        XP = 800, -- The XP required to reach this rank
        Action = function(rankUp, prevRank, player)
            -- rankUp: boolean      - whether the player reached or dropped to this rank
            -- prevRank: number     - the player's previous rank
            -- player: integer      - The current player            
        end
    },
    [3] = { XP = 2100 },
    [4] = { XP = 3800 },
    ...
}
```

# QBCore Integration

If `Config.UseQBCore` is set to `true` then the player's xp and rank are stored in their metadata. The metadata is saved whenever a player's xp / rank changes.

#### Client
```lua
local PlayerData = QBCore.Functions.GetPlayerData()
local xp = PlayerData.metadata.xp
local rank = PlayerData.metadata.rank
```

#### Server
```lua
local Player = QBCore.Functions.GetPlayer(src)
local xp = Player.PlayerData.metadata.xp
local rank = Player.PlayerData.metadata.rank
```

# ESX Integration

#### Server
```lua
local xPlayer = ESX.GetPlayerById(src)
local xp = xPlayer.get('xp')
local rank = xPlayer.get('rank')
```


# Commands
```lua
-- Set the theme
/setXPTheme [theme]
```

# Admin Commands

These require ace permissions: e.g. `add_ace group.admin command.addXP allow`

```lua
-- Award XP to player
/addXP [playerId] [xp]

-- Deduct XP from player
/removeXP [playerId] [xp]

-- Set a player's XP
/setXP [playerId] [xp]

-- Set a player's rank
/setRank [playerId] [rank]
```

# Themes
The theme can be set by the player using the `/setXPTheme [theme]` command. The `theme` argument must exist in the `Config.Themes` table in `config.lua` for it to work:

```lua
Config.Theme  = 'native'  -- Set the default theme (must exist in the Config.Themes table)
 
Config.Themes = {
    native = {
        segments = 10,  -- Sets the number of segments the XP bar has. Native = 10, Max = 20
        width = 532     -- Sets the width of the XP bar in px
    },

    hitman = {
        segments = 80,
        width = 800
    },
    
    hexagon = {
        segments = 16,
        width = 400
    },
}
```

# Custom Themes

Let's say you want to add a theme called `myTheme`:

* Add the theme table to the `Config.Themes` table using the name of the theme as the index:

```lua
Config.Themes = {
    ...
    
    myTheme = {
        segments = 20,
        width = 650
    }
}
```

* Create the theme's `.css` file in `ui/css` directory with the `theme-` prefix:
```
ui/css/theme-myTheme.css
```

* Set `Config.Theme` to read your new theme:
```lua
Config.Theme = 'myTheme'
```

#### Markup for making themes:
```html
<div class="xperience">
    <div class="xperience-inner">
        <div class="xperience-rank">

# FAQ

### How do I award players XP for X amount of playtime?

Example of awarding players 100XP for every 30mins of playtime
```lua
-- Server side
CreateThread(function()
    local interval = 30   -- interval in minutes
    local xp = 100        -- XP amount to award every interval

    while true do
        for i, src in pairs(GetPlayers()) do
            TriggerClientEvent('xperience:client:addXP', src, xp)
        end
        
        Wait(interval * 60 * 1000)
    end
end)
```

### How do I give XP to a player when they've done something?

Example of giving a player 100 XP for shooting another player
```lua
AddEventHandler('gameEventTriggered', function(event, data)
    if event == "CEventNetworkEntityDamage" then
        local victim      = tonumber(data[1])
        local attacker    = tonumber(data[2])
        local weaponHash  = tonumber(data[5])
        local meleeDamage = tonumber(data[10]) ~= 0 and true or false 

        -- Don't register melee damage
        if not meleeDamage then
            -- Check victim and attacker are both players
            if (IsEntityAPed(victim) and IsPedAPlayer(victim)) and (IsEntityAPed(attacker) and IsPedAPlayer(attacker)) then
                if attacker == PlayerPedId() then -- We are the attacker
                    exports.xperience:AddXP(100) -- Give player 100 xp for getting a hit
                end
            end
        end
    end
end)
```

### How do I do something when a player's rank changes?

You can either utilise [Rank Events](#client-events) or [Rank Actions](#rank-actions).

Example of giving a minigun with `500` bullets to a player for reaching rank `10`:

#### Rank Event
```lua
AddEventHandler("xperience:client:rankUp", function(newRank, previousRank, player)
    if newRank == 10 then
        local weapon = `WEAPON_MINIGUN`
        
        if not HasPedGotWeapon(player, weapon, false) then
            -- Player doesn't have weapon so give it them loaded with 500 bullets
            GiveWeaponToPed(player, weapon, 500, false, false)
        else
            -- Player has the weapon so give them 500 bullets for it
            AddAmmoToPed(player, weapon, 500)
        end
    end
end)
```

#### Rank Action
```lua
Config.Ranks = {
    [1] = { XP = 0 },
    [2] = { XP = 800 },
    [3] = { XP = 2100 },
    [4] = { XP = 3800 },
    [5] = { XP = 6100 },
    [6] = { XP = 9500 },
    [7] = { XP = 12500 },
    [8] = { XP = 16000 },
    [9] = { XP = 19800 },
    [10] = {
        XP = 24000,
        Action = function(rankUp, prevRank, player)
            if rankUp then -- only run when player moved up to this rank
                local weapon = `WEAPON_MINIGUN`
        
                if not HasPedGotWeapon(player, weapon, false) then
                    -- Player doesn't have weapon so give it them loaded with 500 bullets
                    GiveWeaponToPed(player, weapon, 500, false, false)
                else
                    -- Player has the weapon so give them 500 bullets for it
                    AddAmmoToPed(player, weapon, 500)
                end
            end
        end
    },
    [11] = { XP = 28500 },
    ...
}
```
