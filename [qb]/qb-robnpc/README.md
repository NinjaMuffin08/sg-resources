# qb-robnpc
Simple as it reads.

Aim an NPC Speak and/or press <BUTTON> to hold em up and give you money and/or items. <Selected in the Config file>
This was adapted from a simple Robnpc script by c0deina/esx_robnpc. PROPS!!

This should work on most QBCORE servers and added as a resource in the servconfig.

All polishing and added features are mine, feel free to modify to your liking. 
There is not currently as of 5/7/2022 a QBCORE version of ROBNPC that is free so 
HERE YOU GO!!

Future Edits might include 

config options for Items >
  Recive randome items from NPCs and probability of getting them like [some item] [(percent of getting it)] in config file
  % chance of npc being armed and drawing on you after robbing
  
better anim ped control
weapons list that might influance % of items or % of returing fire
